    <h2>QUITE FABULOUS!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Story of the Times, dedicated to Professor
    Munro.</i>)</h4>

    <p>KING COLE, although described as a "merry old soul," was in
    reality a tyrant. He had a number of subjects who used to work
    underground, and their labour was to bring to the surface the
    black diamonds of the earth. It was not altogether a pleasant
    occupation, but still, the task had to be accomplished. His
    Majesty was fond of ferocious practical jokes, and perchance
    this may have been the origin of the jocular description
    attached to his name. One day, some of his subjects complained
    that their hours of labour were too many.</p>

    <p>"How long do you work?" asked the King.</p>

    <p>"May it please you, Sire, sixteen," was the reply.</p>

    <p>"Try what you can do with twelve," and they were about to
    depart rejoicing, when the Monarch called them back and added,
    "But mind you, I shall expect just as many black diamonds to be
    unearthed as before."</p>

    <p>So the King's subjects worked only twelve hours, and strange
    to say, quite as many black diamonds were produced as in the
    olden days. Then the workmen began to grumble once more, and
    the King again interviewed them.</p>

    <p>"Do you still work twelve hours?" he asked the
    deputation.</p>

    <p>"Certainly, Your Majesty; but we think half would be quite
    enough," returned the spokesman.</p>

    <p>"By all means&mdash;why not make it three hours?" and again
    his subjects were departing, rejoicing, when once more he
    added, "But I shall expect just the same output as before."</p>

    <p>And he got it, for the men worked harder than ever. And then
    they came yet again to him. Once more they considered the hours
    of labour excessive. They thought sixty minutes plenty.</p>

    <p>"So do I," replied the Monarch, "not only plenty, but too
    many. But as it is scarcely worth while employing you only half
    an hour a day, I shall make other arrangements."</p>

    <p>And from that time forth he brought up his black diamonds
    from the centre of the earth by machinery!</p>

    <p>In the Christmas Numbers of the numerous picture-papers it
    is at first rather difficult to discover which is the genuine
    article illustrated, and which the advertisement, likewise
    illustrated. In the outside picture of the Christmas Number of
    <i>The Penny Illustrated Paper</i>, which represents a couple
    dancing together, I am not yet quite sure that the handsome
    Hebraic gentleman, dancing with a fair Anglo-Saxon girl, is not
    assuring his frightened-looking partner that "Epps's Cocoa is
    Grateful&mdash;Comforting," as stated in the paragraph
    immediately beneath the aforesaid picture. On the next page is
    a sad illustration entitled, "The Curse of Revenge. Lost to
    Human Aid." which turns out to be not a Christmas story at all,
    but an advertisement for Fruit Salt. Then opposite this
    commences a story by GEORGE R. SIMS; and at the foot of this
    page some one replies, "Mr. DOOLAN! There's no one of that name
    here now, Sir." Whereupon, being interested, the reader turns
    over page 1 to find at the head of page 2, not the continuation
    of the above interesting story in the shape of some remark on
    the part of the inquirer, nor any account of what happened
    after this reply had been given, but simply "Benson's Watches"
    followed by "Fry's Chocolate," then a picture (not an
    advertisement) facing that, and then on page 4 the remainder of
    the dialogue. It doesn't much matter perhaps, as the excitement
    aroused by the story is not violent, and the mistake of giving
    somebody else's card for your own does not occur here for the
    first time as the motive of a plot. CUTHBERT BEDE's name is to
    a "Christmas Carol," and Mr. JOHN LATEY's to a dramatically
    told tale called "Mark Temple's Trial," in which the imaginary
    heroine pays a visit to a very real person of the name of
    Madame KATTI LANNER, whose pupils are represented as all
    assembled, with bouquets and posies, to do honour to the
    birthday of their "well-loved mistress," who is at the same
    time, "the acknowledged mistress of the choreographic art." In
    this story, the author is to be complimented on his invention
    of the name, "Lord Morgagemore" as an ancient looking and
    highly aristocratic Irish title.</p>

    <p>"Up to any game at Christmas, if it's not too high," says
    the Baron of Hampershire, who detests all game that is lofty,
    but is glad to welcome a Shakspearian Revival by MYERS &amp;
    Co. in the shape of a <i>Nine Men's Morris</i>, a title the
    Baron recommends to the notice of Mr. WILLIAM MORRIS, yclept
    "BILLY," when he is making another bouquet of poesies. By the
    way, BIM BROS.' Almanac Cards, one of the Baron's Lady Helps
    describes as "decidedly dainty." Christmas is specially a
    card-playing season, a time of <i>Pax</i> to everybody.</p>

    <p>From the <i>Gordon Stables</i> of HUTCHINSON &amp; Co.
    issues the nightmare tale of <i>The Cruise in the Crystal
    Boat</i>; when finished, try their <i>Family Difficulty</i>, by
    SARAH DOUDNEY. Send to the Deanery of DEAN AND SON, ask for
    <i>Baby's Biography</i> and <i>The Little One's Own
    Beehive</i>. The Spindleside department of the Baron's
    Booking-Office recommends both the above for the Tiny Trots;
    while the Spearside tells the boys to go in for MANVILLE FENN's
    <i>Burr Junior</i> and Mrs. R. LEE's <i>Adventures in
    Australia</i>. Then for all-comers, procure BEATRICE HARRADEN's
    <i>New Book of Fairies</i>, for, our "Co." thus puts it, "This
    is all concerning those poor little Fairies, about whom no one
    takes any trouble, and who are left out in the cold at
    Christmas time." Thus for this week conclude the duties of
    Mesdames BLYTHE and GAY, the Baron's Lady Assistant Perusers.
    "I trust my gentle Public will benefit by their advice,"

    CHESEPARE some day, when anything happens to the old Earl. He
    was looking quite ghastly when we were down at SKYMPINGS last.
    But they're frightfully badly off <i>now</i>, poor dears! Lady

    <p><i>Colonel Sandown.</i> He looked pretty fit at the Rag the
    other day. Come across the SENLACS anywhere? Thought Lady
    SENLAC was going abroad this year.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. Crawley Strutt.</i> Hem&mdash;I saw it mentioned in
    the <i>Penny Patrician</i> that her Ladyship had&mdash;</p>

    <p><i>Mrs. Hurl.</i> (<i>without taking the slightest notice of
    him</i>). She's just been marryin' her daughter, you
    know&mdash;rather a good match, too. Not what I call
    pretty,&mdash;smart-lookin', that's all. But then her
    <i>sister</i> wasn't pretty till she married.</p>

    <p><i>Col. Sand.</i> Nice family she married into! Met her
    father-in-law, old Lord BLETHERHAM, the other morning, at a
    chemist's in Piccadilly&mdash;he'd dropped in there for a
    pick-me-up; and there he was, tellin' chemist all the troubles
    he'd had with his other sons marryin' the way they did, and
    that. Rum man to go and confide in his chemist, but he's like

    <p><i>Col. S.</i> Is it? What have they been up to now, eh?
    Haven't seen a paper for days.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.S.</i> I mean these mixed marriages, and, well,
    their general goings on, I don't know if you're acquainted with
    a paper called the <i>Penny Patrician</i>? I take it in
    regularly, and I assure <i>you</i>&mdash;loyal supporter of our

    <p><i>Col. S.</i> Do they, though? If I were you I should let
    'em do their own blushin', and save my pennies.</p>

    <p><i>Mr. C.S.</i> (<i>deferentially</i>). No doubt you're
    right, Sir, but I <i>like</i> the <i>Patrician</i>
    myself&mdash;it's very smartly written. Talking of that, do you
    happen to know the ins and outs of that marriage of young Lord
    GOSLINGTON's? Something very mysterious about the party he's
    going to marry&mdash;who <i>are</i> her people now?</p>

    remark to a very pleasant little fellow I met on the
    steamer&mdash;er&mdash;Lord UPPERSOLE, I think it was&mdash;and

    PRENDERGAST. A short cut is invariably the most indirect
    route.</p>

    <p><i>Miss P.</i> (<i>with intention</i>). You hear what Mr.
    CULCHARD says, my dear MAUD? He advocates direct ways, as best
    in the long run.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> It's only going to be a short run, my love.
    But I'm vurry glad to observe that you and Mr. CULCHARD are so
    perfectly harmonious, as I'm leaving him on your hands for a
    spell. Aren't you ever coming, Mr. PRENDERGAST?</p>

    <h2>THE GOOD NEW "TIMES."</h2>

    <p>Nobody, after visiting Terry's Theatre, can apply to Mr.
    PINERO's piece the hackneyed phrase,&mdash;used apologetically
    by an unconscionable reader after detaining the leading journal
    for three-quarters of an hour,&mdash;"Oh, there's nothing in
    <i>The Times</i>," for, in Mr. PINERO's piece there is plenty
    of amusement, if not of absorbing interest.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/269-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/269-1.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The story is that of a <i>parvenu</i>, whose sole object in
    life, to be recognised by "Society," is thwarted by the
    marriage of his good-for-nothing son with the daughter of an
    Irish lodging-house keeper. The struggles of <i>Mr. and Mrs.
    Bompas</i> to conceal this <i>mésalliance</i>, and the
    assistance given them in their difficulties by the <i>Hon.
    Montague Trimble</i>, constitute the motive of the play. But
    the question that must occur to the critical mind is, "Did the
    author mean this piece for high comedy, or farcical comedy?" If
    the former, then Mr. TERRY is wrong in his conception of the
    part; if the latter, everybody else is wrong in their
    conception of their parts.</p>

    <p>It seems to me as if, in the course of rehearsal, the
    peculiarities distinguishing the character of <i>Percy Egerton
    Bompas, M.P.</i>, had gradually become assimilated with the
    individualities of the actor, Mr. EDWARD TERRY. If Mr. PINERO
    so meant it, if he so wrote it for Mr. TERRY and for Mr. TERRY
    only, then there is nothing more to be said; Mr. PINERO's ideal
    is realised. But if the author did <i>not</i> intend Mr.
    TERRY's impersonation, then he must be content to sacrifice the
    ideal to the real, shrug his shoulders, and pocket his profits.
    Yet, as if making an appeal to the public to judge between the
    auctorial abstract and the representational concrete, Mr.
    PINERO not only publishes his playbook, but sells it in the
    theatre. Visitors to TERRY's, who buy the book, will judge the
    play by its stage interpretation that has had the advantage of
    the author's personal supervision and direction. The
    representation, therefore, is either more or less in accordance
    with his teaching, or flatly contradicts it.</p>

    <div class="figright"

    <p>The publication of the book of a comedy in a theatre may be
    thankfully received as a present help to the audience, and an
    aid to memory afterwards, or it may be considered as a protest
    on the part of the author who says, "Here's what I have
    written. See how they act it: whether it be farce or comedy,
    judge for yourselves. You pay your money, and you take your
    choice." Suffice it, then, to record that, on the night of this
    deponent's visit, the piece played from eight till past eleven,
    and that the audience from first to last was generally amused,
    but, I should be inclined to say, particularly disappointed at
    the collapse of Mr. TERRY's part in the last Act (the principal
    portion of which he passes curled up on a sofa, with the top of
    his forehead powdered white! Why?), and mystified by the sudden
    and apparently unnecessary revelation, made by <i>Miss
    Cazalet</i>, to the effect that <i>Lucy Tuck</i> (a mentally
    and physically short-sighted girl) is her illegitimate
    daughter; and these two last-named personages, though essential
    to the plot, fail unfortunately in rousing any sentiment of
    pity or of sympathy.</p>

    <p>Mr. ELLIOT is excellent as the <i>Hon. Montague Trimble</i>;
    nothing better, apart from Mr. HARE's eccentric characters, has
    been seen on the stage for some considerable time. I hope the
    author is of the same opinion. Mr. FRED THORNE is capital as
    the Irish Member; and as <i>Mrs. Hooley</i>, an obtrusively
    Irish eccentricity of Thackerayan extraction, Miss ALEXES
    LEIGHTON is very good, for the character, as drawn by the
    author, <i>is</i> obtrusive, and is so meant to be. The <i>Mrs.
    Egerton Bompas</i> of Miss FANNY BROUGH is <i>the</i> woman to
    the life, and, in my humble judgment, Miss BROUGH's
    impersonation is well-nigh faultless. Whether, if the part of
    <i>Egerton Bompas</i> were played as high comedy, this would
    still improve Miss BROUGH's impersonation of <i>Mrs. Bompas</i>
    or not, it is difficult to decide; but I am inclined to think
    this would be the result. What does the author think? Most
    likely he will continue to "think"; it is the wiser course. Mr.
    HENRY V. ESMOND makes the lad, <i>Howard Bompas</i>,
    unnecessarily repulsive; but if, in doing so, he is only
    exactly carrying out the author's idea, <i>i.e.</i>, "Master's
    orders," then he is no longer responsible for the overcharged
    colouring. The probable fate of this unhappy pair, an impulsive
    uneducated kind of Irish orange-girl married to a contemptible
    young sot, is not a pleasant termination to the story, nor is
    the anticipatory sadness felt for the future of this
    ill-assorted couple in any way dissipated by the stereotyped
    and perfunctory offer of marriage made by the young London
    Journal Nobleman to the daughter of the utterly crushed snob
    just before the Curtain descends.</p>

    <p>Why the piece is called <i>The Times</i>, remains a mystery.
    <i>To-day</i> would have been better; that is, if by <i>The
    Times</i> is only meant "The Present Day." And if it doesn't
    mean this, what meaning has it? For alliterative advertisement
    it may be useful; <i>e.g.</i>, "Times at TERRY's." The dialogue
    generally is easy, natural and telling.</p>

    <p>We understand that Mr. GLADSTONE has followed, with much
    interest, the speeches delivered in the country last week, and
    was observed to be visibly affected at the touching spectacle
    of the final reconciliation of Lord SALISBURY and Mr.
    CHAMBERLAIN at Birmingham. "They toil not, neither do they

    <p>The Right Hon. Gentleman will take his turn next week, and a
    report is current in interested quarters, that he as gone into
    training under the personal direction of Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT
    and Mr. JOHN MORLEY, who assist to support him whilst he
    rehearses his speech. This is a fantasy of disordered
    imagination. Mr. G. is in splendid form, spoiling for a
    fight.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>A trustworthy Correspondent informs us that, owing to
    accidental displacement of his notes, a telling point was
    omitted from Lord SALISBURY's first speech at Birmingham. It
    was intended to come in at the passage where the PREMIER boldly
    flouted apprehension, of Ministerial disaster at the General
    Election. He had meant to cite Mr. JACKSON's appointment as
    conclusive proof that the Government would exist at least up to
    the year 1900.</p>

    <p>"SHAKSPEARE," he should have said, "has written, 'a tanner
    will last you nine year,' and of course the duration of the
    Government will be co-incidental with the prolongation of the
    term of our Financial Secretary to the Treasury, withdrawn from
    commercial pursuits at Leeds."</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>HERR VON DER BLOWITZOWN-TROMP has some interesting
    reminiscences of the lamented Baron MAC HINERY. "When he was
    appointed Legate at the Court of the Isle of Man," writes the
    great historian of our times, "he dined with me in passing
    through Nanterre. It was the very day the Marquis DE MOULIN had
    been elected Pompier. The other guests were, His Excellency the
    CON OF CRIM TARTARY, Prince ALLEZ-VOUS-EN, His Excellency the
    VICUNA of BRAZIL, the SANDWICH AMBASSADOR, the DOGE of VENICE,
    and the Baron MUNCHAUSEN, who was a kind of amateur partner of
    mine, in whom I had much confidence&mdash;I always left him
    with my day's correspondence ready to be committed to paper. In
    the course of the dinner a stupid <i>garçon</i>, handing the
    ice round, dropped a small piece down the back of the neck of
    the DOGE of VENICE. With great presence of mind Baron
    MUNCHAUSEN seized the poker (which fortunately happened to be
    in the fire), and, with inimitable dexterity, passed the
    red-hot brand between the DOGE's shirt-collar and his neck,
    and, deftly touching the piece of ice, melted it. It was an
    awkward moment. The canned lobster was just served, but no one
    thought of eating it. The CON of CRIM TARTARY turning to Baron
    MAC HINERY, said,&mdash;</p>

    <p>"You, my Lord, who are disinterested in this matter, tell us
    what you think of it."</p>

    <p>"I think," replied the Baron, with admirable
    <i>sangfroid</i>, "his Highness the DOGE would have felt better
    if the ice had been warmer, and the poker cooler."</p>

    <p>Everybody laughed. The DOGE and Baron MUNCHAUSEN shook
    hands, and the dinner ended gaily.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>RYMOND, writing <i>lui-même</i> with too infrequent pen,
    makes pathetic reference to the death of "one of the largest
    and best known purveyors of Rhine wine, with whom I have had
    business relations and personal intercourse for nearly thirty
    years." There is, we need hardly say, no basis for the
    insinuation thrown out by HENED that the business relations
    referred to were of the commission order sometimes established
    between purveyors of Rhine and other wines and gentlemen who
    have a wide circle of friends.</p>

        Carriage. Theoretical Passenger and Practical Passenger
        discussing the "Unreadiness of England."</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><i>Theoretical Passenger</i> (<i>at the conclusion of a long
    account of the national shortcomings</i>). Yes, my dear Sir,
    France has only to declare war to-morrow, and we are completely
    ruined! We cease to exist as a nation!</p>

    <p><i>Practical Passenger</i> (<i>with a smile</i>). But hasn't
    this been said about us&mdash;by ourselves&mdash;for any number
    of years?</p>

    <p><i>Theo. Pas.</i> Doubtless, but that does not make it the
    less true.</p>

    <p><i>Prac. Pas.</i> Possibly; still, it is encouraging to find
    that we <i>do</i> exist in spite of the "temptation to belong
    to other nations."</p>

    <p><i>Theo. Pas.</i> (<i>annoyed</i>). Ah! you treat the matter
    with levity; but I assure you it is a most serious thing! How
    would you like to be bombarded?</p>

    <p><i>Prac. Pas.</i> Not at all. The more especially as it
    would be a great expense to the enemy.</p>

    <p><i>Theo. Pas.</i> (<i>with dignified resentment</i>). I see
    you consider the subject a proper topic for raillery! It is a
    very fine day!</p>

    <p><i>Prac. Pas.</i> (<i>in a conciliatory tone</i>). No, no, I
    can assure you I am deeply interested. But how about our
    Fleet&mdash;surely that should protect us?</p>

    <p><i>Theo. Pas.</i> You must be very much behind the age to
    say so. Our Fleet is practically valueless. It is perfectly
    easy to invade us at a dozen places. If the French went to
    Ireland (as they did in the last century), the conquest of
    England would be assured. They would (with the assistance of a
    friendly peasantry), get their supplies and make good their
    footing.</p>

    <p><i>Prac. Pas.</i> But how about our Army?</p>

    <p><i>Theo. Pas.</i> A farce! An expensive farce. We have no
    Regulars, the Militia exists only on paper, and the Volunteers
    are valueless.</p>

    <p><i>Prac. Pas.</i> Then why not have a
    Conscription&mdash;that would bring up our Army with a run?</p>

    <p><i>Theo. Pas.</i> A Conscription! My dear Sir, the nation
    wouldn't think of such a thing! No, not for a single
    moment!</p>

    <p><i>Prac. Pas.</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). Well, what is to
    be done?</p>

    <p><i>Theo. Pas.</i> (<i>promptly</i>). Nothing, except to
    write to the papers and submit to our fate.</p>

    <p><i>Prac. Pas.</i> Is there any objection to the construction

    <h2>"ON THE HYP"-NOTIST.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Fragment from a Romance purely imaginary and yet to be
    written.</i>)</h4>

    <p>The <i>Savants</i> were gathered together to consider the
    question of Hypnotism. They had been appointed by a learned
    Association, and their Hon. Secretary had distinguished himself
    by writing a letter, which if eccentric in punctuation, was yet
    to the point.</p>

    <p>"We must not forget, Gentlemen," said one of the learned
    persons, "that we have been appointed to investigate the use of
    Hypnotism as a therapeutic agent. It will be our duty to
    ascertain, if it is possible, that operations can be performed
    under the shield of its anæsthesia."</p>

    <p>"You are indeed right," replied another, "and it is
    fortunate in one sense that we have not had the advantage of
    greeting at our board, Doctor OWEN COLEMAN of Dunedin,
    Surbiton."</p>

    <p>"Why so?" asked a third.</p>

    <p>"Because," returned <i>Savant</i> No. 2, "that distinguished
    Member of the Medical Profession can give instances of
    successful treatment under the prescribed circumstances. For
    instance, JULES CLOQUET, as early as 1845 was using Hypnotism
    in the cause of painless surgery. However, our pleasant little
    gathering can do no harm."</p>

    <p>"Perhaps not," acquiesced <i>Savant</i> No. 3. "Although it
    is only right to remark that had we had Dr. COLEMAN's
    knowledge, we should have possibly considered it <i>qua</i>
    Committee a trifle superfluous."</p>

    <p>"Do you not think we ought to visit the Aquarium?" asked the
    first speaker. "I am told that there is a Hypnotist who appears
    there twice a-day, and whose exhibition, from a scientific
    point of view, should be decidedly interesting."</p>

    <p>After this there was a speedy departure, and for some hours
    the Committee lounged about the Aquarium, They there saw a
    female acrobat of great strength. Then they paid a visit to the
    Alhambra, where they met a pleasant young lady, who, seemingly
    without any assistance, lifted four or five bulky gentlemen
    seated on a chair. This she did without any exertion and with a
    smiling countenance. On their return to their private room,
    they seemed somewhat hostile to the pretensions of the
    Hypnotist, whose feats they had just witnessed&mdash;they
    preferred to his performances the feats of the Magnetic
    Lady.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:30%;">
        <a href="images/275-2.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/275-2.png"
             alt="" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>"Quite a mistake," said one; "instead of taking off a leg,
    or showing the strength of a billiard cue, he makes men believe
    that they are swimming in a tank!"</p>

    <p>"Very undignified," remarked another; "it would have been so
    much better had he performed a surgical operation&mdash;say,
    setting a compound fracture of the leg, like that performed by
    two medical men in 1845; and more interesting to the vast
    majority of the audience."</p>

    <p>"But the Alhambra was excellent," was the reply. "Suppose we
    send to our Committee a Report of the 'Magnetic Lady' and
    ignore the Hypnotist?"</p>

    <p>And so it was decided, and it was time to write their
    Report. Then pens, ink, and paper were produced, and the
    <i>Savants</i> prepared for work. They had scarcely commenced,
    when a gentleman stood in their midst, and glared at them. He
    gave them each a disc, and commanded them to gaze upon its
    surface. Then, one by one, they fell over fast asleep. He
    placed them back in their chairs.</p>

    <p>"Now for your Report," he murmured. "And so you would ignore
    <i>my</i> show and praise another! But you are in my power, and
    <i>shall</i> obey me! Write what I dictate!" And so they wrote.
    And, strange as it may appear to non-believers in Hypnotism,
    the Report, when published, was found to be an excellent
    advertisement for the Royal Westminster Aquarium!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
